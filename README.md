Seoul Bike Demand Prediction
ðŸ“Œ Project Aim
The aim of this project is to predict the number of bikes rented per hour in Seoul using various regression models. The objective is to identify the most effective machine learning model for accurate prediction, while also analyzing which features most strongly influence bike rental demand.
The dataset used in this project is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
Dataset Name: Seoul Bike Sharing Demand
It contains hourly bike rental data along with environmental and seasonal variables.
